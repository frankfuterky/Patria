                    There was a time where group of people gathered as folklore ensemble due to PE lessons
No one knew each other, they were strangers not talking to one another. 
they met one day and then they spend all the time together.

                        They were meeting sweating and rehearsing to be one of the best. 
They took parts in festivals in Brazil, Tunisia, Egypt  taking polish culture with them and showing it all around the world.

They didn’t know that this will bring them so close that they will become a one big family. 
Literally some of them became a family when couples turn into marriages in the ensemble with kids growing in the Patrias culture from the beginning.

But as almost every group of friends with flying time they started to growing apart. They finished studying, got a job, families were growing and that became a priority. They tried to keep in contact, even once in a while but as in normal life they all went into different directions.

                    Until the moment when the ensemble celebrated its birthday, and one of them decided to gather them all together, to keep the almost forgotten “momentum “ going. 
He didn’t expect that people will be ready to come back. He didn’t know that almost the whole group will be able to “ do it one more time”

During this years they faced many problems and challenges, but despite that, they are still going and still continuing with all the love and passion like they had 30 years ago.
